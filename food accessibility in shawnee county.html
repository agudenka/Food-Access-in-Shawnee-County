            <sub><i>“This map, produced by the Kansas Health Institute, shows food insecurity rates by zip code. Two of the zip codes affected by losing the grocery store in central Topeka have the county’s highest rate of people struggling to stock their pantries — nearly a third of the population.”-  Celia Llopis-Jepsen</i></sub>
        
            <br>

        <p>With so many of our fellow Kansans affected by food insecurity, it’s time to understand the specifics of how it is affecting the 177,000 residents in Shawnee County, Kansas.</p>

        <br>

    <h2>Did You Know?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>People living in central Topeka are four times as likely not to have enough food when compared people living in the 
            suburbs of Topeka.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In 2019, 11 census tracts in Shawnee County were designated as food deserts, meaning they were identified as areas with 
            limited access to healthy and affordable foods. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
