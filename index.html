       <p>There are many ares within the United States in which people have limited access to food that is good for them and within their budget.
           Although Kansas may be known for agriculture, there still are many areas designated as food deserts in our state. Half a million people make up 
           the parts of Kansas where there are few to no grocery sotres. Many of those are urban areas, but there are also rural areas without a grocery
           store within 10 miles.</p>
       <p>If someone does not have their own transportation, they must depend on bussing, or friends to give them rides to the nearest grocery store. Getting 
           a week's worth of groceries on the bus is difficult. To supermarket chains, low-income residents without adequate transportation is not very
           attractive, so they tend to build elsewhere, which exacerbates the problem of food access.</p>
