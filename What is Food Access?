            <h1>What is a Food Access?
             
            <h2>The need for food is universal. It is a basic survival need. 
             
            Food access is availability to healthy, affordable, and suitable foods. There are many factors that impact food access in a particular areas. 
             
            Food access in a given area can be impacted by:
             The types and quality food available 
            The size and  proximity of food stores to residents
            The food that is available can be prepared in a way that contributes to health and well-being
            food supplies are consistently available and stable
             
            An area where there is not enough food access may be called a food desert, or a food apartheid. An area where there is more than enough access to healthy and cost-effective food may be called a food oasis. ---link out the terms to a glossary page—
             
            <h2> Why does Food Access Matter?
             
            <h3>Healthy food serves the body. 
             
            When someone has access to food that is healthy and fresh, they have increased energy, attendance in school, and overall health. They have decreased risk of obesity and hospitalization. If the only options in an area are gas stations and fast food restaurants, residents may need to rely on a nutritionally lacking diet. Unemployment may impact the ability to afford suitable and healthy foods. 
             
            <h3>Healthy food serves the soul. 
             
            Food can connect families and communities. Communities suffer when there is not sufficient access to fresh, healthy, and cost-effective foods. There are many areas in the United States in which people have limited access to food that is good for them and within their budget. An immigrant family may not be able to find the traditional foods that they are accustomed to preparing and eating. 
             
            <em>Food access is about much more than simply the availability of foods for purchase. Consistent, equitable food access for all depends on food systems and social systems that protect and broaden food access1. </em>
            
             
            <h2>What can improve food access?
            A wide range of structural, economic, and societal factors can impact food access. It can include:
            ·      Agriculture: suitable land and weather
            ·      Labor: enough people to work in fields, in grocery stores, and transporting food
            ·      Facilities: locations where people can buy healthy food
            ·      _____: quality of foods provided by donation centers and adequate distribution
            ·      Time: available time to learn about and prepare healthy and fresh meal
            
            Food access is not a singular issue with a singular solution. It emerges from a confluence of systematic relationships that intersect to create inadequate food systems.
