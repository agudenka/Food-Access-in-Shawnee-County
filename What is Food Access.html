        <h1>What is Food Access?</h1>
        <p>Food accessibility is the steady availability of wholesome, inexpensive, and appropriate foods. In other words, Food access is availability to healthy, affordable, and suitable foods.  The need for food is universal. It is a basic survival need. Along with production systems that promote the welfare of food farmers and consumers, physical and financial accessibility are crucial components. There are many factors that impact food access in a particular areas. Food access in a given area can be impacted by:
        The types and quality food available 
        The size and  proximity of food stores to residents
        The food that is available can be prepared in a way that contributes to health and well-being
        food supplies are consistently available and stable. An area where there is not enough food access may be called a food desert, or a food apartheid. An area where there is more than enough access to healthy and cost-effective food may be called a food oasis.</p>
             
            <h2> Why does Food Access Matter?</h2>
            <p> Healthy food serves the body. Healthy and affordable food is a basic survival need. Consistent access to nutritious food supports an individual’s growth, energy levels, and immune system function. When someone has access to food that is healthy and fresh, they have increased energy, attendance in school, and overall health. They have decreased risk of obesity and hospitalization. If the only options in an area are gas stations and fast food restaurants, residents may need to rely on a nutritionally lacking diet. Unemployment may impact the ability to afford suitable and healthy foods. Healthy food serves the soul. 
             Food is also deeply connected with family, community, and social interactions. Community networks and social support systems may also suffer when people lack secure food access. Communities suffer when there is not sufficient access to fresh, healthy, and cost-effective foods. There are many areas in the United States in which people have limited access to food that is good for them and within their budget. An immigrant family may not be able to find the traditional foods that they are accustomed to preparing and eating. 
             <em>Food access is about much more than simply the availability of foods for purchase. Consistent, equitable food access for all depends on food systems and social systems that protect and broaden food access. </em></p>
            
             
            <h2>What can improve food access?</h2>
            <p>A wide range of structural, economic, governmental, and societal factors can impact food access. While the cause is pretty clear, the solution is more complex. It includes a mix of public-private partnerships such as (government support of local, community-based food systems), food justice advocacy, local activism, federal policy innovation, and fighting racism. It’s a tall order, and even though the issue is so urgent, it’s not going to be a sprint. Here are some strategies that could help us actually make access to affordable, healthy food a reality for the millions of people facing food insecurity. It can include:
        <ul><li>Agriculture: suitable land and weather.</li>
            <li>Labor: enough people to work in fields, in grocery stores, and transporting food.</li>
            <li>Facilities: locations where people can buy healthy food.</li>
            <li>Food quality: quality of foods provided by donation centers and adequate distribution.</li>
            <li>Time: available time to learn about and prepare healthy and fresh meal.</li>
        </ul> Food access is not a singular issue with a singular solution. It emerges from a confluence of systematic relationships that intersect to create inadequate food systems.</p>
