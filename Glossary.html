        <h1>Glossary of Terms</h1>
        <p>There are a few terms that are often used when discussing food accessibility:<br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food insecurity:</strong> an economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Food desert:</strong> an area in which residents cannot easily get to stores that sell affordable and healthy foods.</li> 
                <li><strong>Food oasis:</strong> the opposite of food desert – an area with adequate access to supermarkets; fresh and healthy foods.</li>
                <li><strong>Food swamp:</strong> an area where there is a high ratio of unhealthy to healthy food. Food is accessible in this area, but it is not fresh and healthy. </li>
        </ul>

             <ul>  
            <li><strong>Sustainable food movement:</strong> a movement in the United States encouraging people to consider where food comes from, 
                inspiring others to farm, eat locally, and consider approaches to food policy. This movement is predominantly white 
                and does not always acknowledge diverse communities.</li>  
                <li><strong>Food apartheid:</strong> a newer term that be used to describe this situation coined by activist and community organizer 
                Karen Washington. It is important to identify how inadequate food systems are tied to the intersectionality of 
                race and class. Food access advocates may use this term to look at the bigger picture of food systems, race, 
                geography, faith, and economics<sup>1</sup> beyond the sustainable food movement.</li>
        </ul>
            
            Karen Washington refers to “deserts” as an “outsider term” that people associated with desolation, and that a “food apartheid” is preferable as it calls to mind the social injustices that people see and how they can work to erase those injustices.
